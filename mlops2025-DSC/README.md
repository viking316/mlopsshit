# 🏦 Loan Risk Categorization - MLOps Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is designed to classify loan applicants into different **risk categories** based on their financial details, using **Machine Learning and MLOps best practices**. The application is built with **Streamlit** for UI, **XGBoost** for modeling, and includes robust **data processing, training, and evaluation** workflows.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Data Processing Pipeline** - Automates feature transformation and encoding.
✅ **Model Training & Evaluation** - Uses XGBoost for high-performance classification.
✅ **Batch & Single Predictions** - Supports user input and CSV batch processing.
✅ **Logging & Tracking** - Maintains logs for debugging and improvements.
✅ **MLOps Ready** - Modular design for future deployment with CI/CD.
